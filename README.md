Complaint Management System (CMS)
Project Overview
The Complaint Management System (CMS) is a web-based application designed for internal municipal use. It allows employees to submit and track complaints, and administrators to manage complaint resolutions. It developed using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC under the MVC architecture.
This application allows users to log complaints, view complaint history, and for admins to manage those complaints. It uses a fully synchronous request-response cycle with form-based input

- **Employee**
  - Login via session-based authentication
  - Submit new complaints
  - View own complaints
  - Edit/delete complaints before resolution

- **Admin**
  - Login via session-based authentication
  - View all complaints
  - Update complaint status and add remarks

Application Architecture (MVC)

JSP files act as the View – they handle UI rendering and collect input via HTML forms.
Servlets act as the Controller – they receive HTTP requests from JSPs, process logic, call models, and decide which view to display next.
DAO and DTO classes act as the Model – they manage the data, perform database operations, and carry data between layers.
